# Product Mission

## Problem

Administrators managing CrowdStrike Falcon Device Control need USB serial numbers in a specific format to create device control policies. Users have no easy way to find this information through a standard macOS GUI. The only current option for admins is to look up device details in the CrowdStrike Activity Portal, which is time-consuming and not self-service for end users.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** End users who need to request USB stick approval for use on their managed MacBooks
- **Secondary:** IT administrators who manage Falcon Device Control policies and benefit from streamlined USB device identification

## Solution

An internal macOS tool that integrates with the SupportApp (by Root3) to let users easily retrieve and share the correct USB device information directly from their MacBook. This removes the need for admin portal lookups and gives users a self-service path to request USB access.
